<p><strong>Indianapolis, October 26, 2019</strong></p>



<p>The growth of genome data and computational requirements overwhelm the capacity of servers. Many institutions and the NIH are considering cloud computing services as a cost-effective alternative to scale up research. Privacy and security are major concerns when deploying cloud-based data analysis tools. In the past few years, secure computation methods have had significant performance improvement but it is still not clear if they are applicable to biomedical challenges involving big data. The goal of this challenge is to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art methods that ensure rigorous data confidentiality during data analyses in a cloud environment.</p>

This hybrid protocol allows to use multiple libraries during the same computation and provides the possibility to take advantage of the best of three schemes (TFHE, HEAAN and B/FV). We review how different strategies developed for each of these schemes, such as bootstrapping, external product, integer arithmetic and Fourier series, can be combined to evaluate the principle nonlinear functions involved in machine learning.</li></ul>

<p>SwissTech Convention Center, EPFL, June 6, 2019</p>



<p>Trust is indispensable to the prosperity and well-being of societies. For millennia, we developed trust-building mechanisms to facilitate interactions. But as they become increasingly digital, many traditional mechanisms no longer function well, hence trust breaks down.</p>



<p>As a result, low levels of trust discourage us from engaging in new forms of interactions and constrain business opportunities.</p>



<p>We must therefore re-invent trust mechanisms that will contribute to prosperous and peaceful societies in the digital age.</p>



<p>The IC Research Day was a 1-day event, organized by the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/">School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC)</a>, where world-leading experts presented and discussed their work towards achieving &#8216;digital trust&#8217;. EPFL researchers showcased ongoing research projects and engaged with the audience.</p>
